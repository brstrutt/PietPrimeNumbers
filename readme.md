This is a project to create a piet program that calculates the first 100 prime numbers.

Piet is an esoteric programming language that uses pixel art images as source code rather than text files. For a full description of the language [click here](https://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html).

To run it you'll need to push the .png source code file through a piet interpreter. I'll be using [piet.bubbler.one](https://piet.bubbler.one/).
